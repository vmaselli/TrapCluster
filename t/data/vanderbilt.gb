            Sequence tag generated by ligation-mediated PCR representss
            sequences downstream of an integrated gene trap retrovirus and
            corresponds to a gene disrupted in mouse ES cells that may be
            transmitted into the mouse germline. ES cells containing the
            insertion mutation are available on request.
            Class: Gene Trap.

                     Expression of a neomycin resistance gene (Neo) selects for
                     cell clones in which the Neo gene splices to downstream
                     exons. Sequences 3' of the provirus were cloned by
                     ligation-mediated PCR and sequenced using a
                     provirus-specific primer."
